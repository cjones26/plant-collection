### Pair Programming Interview Question for an Expo / React Native Developer
#### Objective:
Develop a simple Expo / React Native application that allows users to track and manage their plant collection. The application should enable users to add new plants, remove plants, and view details about each plant. The application should persist data locally using AsyncStorage.
#### Requirements:
1. **Setup and Initialization**:
  - Create a GitHub account.
  - Install Expo Go on your phone.
2. **Plant Collection Functionality**:
  - Create a `PlantList` component to display the list of plants.
  - Create a `PlantItem` component to represent each plant, name, description, and watering schedule.
  - Implement functionality to add new plants, including name, description, and watering schedule.
  - Implement functionality to delete existing plants.
  - Implement functionality to edit plant details.
3. **Data Persistence**:
  - Use AsyncStorage to persist the plant collection data locally.
  - Load the plant collection data from AsyncStorage when the app starts.
4. **User Interface**:
  - Create a simple and user-friendly UI.
  - Use appropriate React Native components (e.g., `FlatList`, `TextInput`, `Button`, `Image`).
5. **State Management**:
  - Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state within the components.
#### Instructions:
1. **Setup**:
  - Log into GitHub, access CodeSpace link provided by the interviewer.
2. **Implementation**:
  - Implement the `PlantList` and `PlantItem` components.
  - Implement the functionality to add a new plant to the collection.
  - Implement the functionality to delete a plant from the collection.
  - Implement the functionality to edit plant details.
  - Use AsyncStorage to save and load the plant collection data.
3. **Testing and Debugging**:
  - Test the application to ensure that the plant collection data persists across app restarts.
  - Debug any issues that arise during development.
